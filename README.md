# The Neural Process Family

This repo hosts for the code for our preprint "The Neural Process Family: Survey, Applications and Perspectives". 

We will be releasing the code for our 3d point cloud modeling experiments soon! All other experiments have been inspired by the code in this [repo](https://github.com/YannDubs/Neural-Process-Family).
